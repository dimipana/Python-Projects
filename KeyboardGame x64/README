PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

THIS PROJECT CONTAINS A SIMPLE PYTHON GAME USING THE PYGAME LIBRARY.
THE GAME CHANGES THE LAYOUT OF THE PLAYER'S KEYBOARD AND THEN TESTS HIS MEMORY 
OF THE NEW LAYOUT BY PUTTING THE USER TO SPELL CORRECTLY A RANDOM WORD.

IT WAS MY FIRST ATTEMPT TO WORK WITH PYTHON SO THE FILE IS PRETTY BIG AND THE
CODE IS KIND OF PRIMITIVE.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Download the whole file.
2) Run the executable located within.
3) Enjoy.
